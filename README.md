# Compass Finder

This is a Minecraft Fabric client-only mod. This mod enables a normal compass to enter a "ore finding" mode, pointing towards the nearest selected ore block.

The compass will now be able to search for:

- Coal (Normal and Deepslate)
- Copper (Normal and Deepslate)
- Iron (Normal and Deepslate)
- Gold (Normal, Deepslate and Nether)
- Lapis (Normal and Deepslate)
- Redstone (Normal and Deepslate)
- Diamond (Normal and Deepslate)
- Emerald (Normal and Deepslate)
- Nether Quartz
- Ancient Debris

## How to use it

[`Ctrl` / `Cmd`]  + [`Scroll UP` / `Scroll DOWN` / `Arrow UP` / `Arrow DOWN`] while using the compass in the main hand. It will rotate between spawn mode (default) and ore searching (selected ore).

### Commands

- `/compassfinder lodestone [int:X] [int:Y]` point to an arbitrary 2d coordinate in the current dimension. `/compassfinder ls [int:X] [int:Y]` is an alias
