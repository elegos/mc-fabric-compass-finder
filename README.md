# Compass Finder

This is a Minecraft Fabric client-only mod. This mod enables a normal compass to enter a "ore finding" mode, pointing towards the nearest selected ore block.

The compass will now be able to search for:

- Coal (Normal and Deepslate)
- Copper (Normal and Deepslate)
- Iron (Normal and Deepslate)
- Gold (Normal, Deepslate and Nether)
- Lapis (Normal and Deepslate)
- Redstone (Normal and Deepslate)
- Diamond (Normal and Deepslate)
- Emerald (Normal and Deepslate)
- Nether Quartz
- Ancient Debris

## How to use it

`Ctrl / Cmd` + `scroll wheel up/down` while using the compass in the main hand. It will rotate between spawn mode (default) and ore searching (selected ore).
